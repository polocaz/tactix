Spent more time digging into es-2140
	spoke with michael and compared notes on our cases, but they dont seem related

	got new data this morning for my case so planning on going through that shortly

Spent some time looking at an iphone issue that sebastian was looking into.
There is an undesired behavior when Send DB to Master is enabled on mobile
	Basically we are sending up a DisconnectedDB record without ever sending the DB
	Ticket probably coming our way 

Issue that vadym and victoriia saw this morning where connectivity was really slow and there are lots of different errors
	Still trying to figure out what happened here
