**AI System:** Parallel behavior updates with type-specific seek/flee logic

## 🧟 Tactical Zombie Survival Simulation

A complex outbreak scenario with emergent tactical gameplay from simple agent rules. Zombies spawn in the graveyard, civilians defend their homes, and heroes mount organized resistance.

### Agent Types & AI States

**Civilians (White/Light Gray)** - 90% of initial population
- **AI States:** Idle → Patrol (wander) → Fleeing (panic or seek hero)
- **Behavior:** 30% flee to nearest hero, 70% panic flee (sticky decision)
- **Speed:** 40 px/s base, 45 px/s when panicking
- **Spawn:** Near buildings (home defense)
- **Death:** Convert to 3-health zombie on contact

**Zombies (Green)** - 5% of initial population  
- **AI States:** Patrol (wander) → Pursuing (chase) → Searching (last-seen)
- **Behavior:** Horde cohesion (0.3), gunshot attraction (300px, 3s), sprint when close
- **Speed:** 35 px/s patrol, 45 px/s sprint (<30px to target)
- **Health:** 3 hits to kill (ranged or melee)
- **Spawn:** Graveyard (200×200px dark zone, bottom-left)

**Heroes (Blue Gradient)** - 5% of initial population
- **AI States:** Patrol (wander) → Pursuing (hunt/kite) → Searching (investigate)
- **Personalities:** 50% Hunter (chase 55 speed), 50% Defender (kite 45 speed <70px)
- **Combat:** Ranged shooting (100px, 0.3-0.6s aim, 1.5s cooldown), melee backup
- **Exhaustion:** After 5 kills → convert to 3-health zombie
- **Spawn:** Strategic top positions for defense

### Combat Systems

- **Ranged Combat** - Heroes shoot at 100px range with variable aim delay
- **Visual Feedback** - Yellow gunshot lines (0.8px, 0.15s fade)
- **Gunshot Attraction** - Zombies hear shots and converge on location
- **Zombie Health** - 3 hits required, tracks damage per zombie
- **Melee Combat** - Close-range (15px) as backup for heroes
- **Hero Exhaustion** - Kill counter tracks fatigue, eventual conversion

### Environment & Physics

- **Buildings** - 8 procedural structures (80-150px) for civilian spawn
- **Trees** - 30 scattered (15-25px radius) creating forest obstacles  
- **Graveyard** - Dark purple zone with 8 tombstones marking outbreak origin
- **Hard Collision** - Agents cannot phase through obstacles
- **Tangential Deflection** - Slide along walls/trees naturally
- **Avoidance Forces** - 5x strength at 50px detection for steering

### Emergent Gameplay

- **Last Stands** - Heroes cornered in buildings create dramatic shootouts
- **Horde Waves** - Zombies cluster and sweep across the map
- **Civilian Tactics** - Some flee to heroes (escorts), others panic (doomed)
- **Chokepoints** - Building gaps and tree lines create tactical terrain
- **Sound Tactics** - Gunshots both kill zombies and attract more
